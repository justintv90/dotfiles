2016-09-02 10:30:56	snappy	ok.
2016-09-02 10:31:11	Guest5598	I am used to python, where you slice a string using str[start:stop:step]

2016-09-02 10:31:57	Guest5598	So, in my use case, I'm slicing a string that's coming over a websocket, which contains a binary value (1 or 0) as the first character, followed by a timestamp.

2016-09-02 10:34:36	Guest5598	But I gather that Golang handles strings (and unicode/UTF-8 and the whole works) differently, and slightly more sophisticatedly. Obviously I haven't quite wrapped my head around it, because when I slice the string it turns into "�"

2016-09-02 15:39:35	jer0me	hey there. Since I needed json serialization, I used to use map[string]somestruct construct with an optional []int64 for `somestruct` IDs, then requiring an int64 to string conversion to fetch value from the map. Do we have some benchmarks for map[int]struct vs map[string]struct lookup and json un/marshal performance?

2016-09-02 18:25:37	vladimiroff	I'm trying to figure out how to check for unintentionally shadowed consts. Suppose we have this snippet: https://play.golang.org/p/o-2pQ7-odS

2016-09-02 18:27:32	vladimiroff	If you run  go tool vet -shadow=true -shadowstrict=true main.go it gets correctly that number is being shadowed: "main.go:8: declaration of "number" shadows declaration at main.go:5"
2016-09-02 18:27:32	vladimiroff	However, is number is a const, then the vet tools doesn't detect this as a shadow, even though the same semantic applies

2016-09-02 18:28:08	vladimiroff	I assume this is due to the changed type (because "const number" is just a numeric type, not neccesary an int like "var number"). But still would like to be able to catch such errors
2016-09-02 18:28:09	vladimiroff	Any ideas?

2016-09-02 21:53:52	asti	hello. how many go routines can I spawn simultaneously? I have to do some backend calls while processing my data. And I'm thinking to use a queue and one go routine to take something from the queue and make the call. Alternatively, I can spawn a new go routines for each call without any queues. So, how many go routines can I create simultaneously?

2016-09-02 22:36:16	pestle	right.
2016-09-02 22:36:34	pestle	not that the SV model of "slap it together and iterate" is exactly a good one for these things, either
2016-09-02 22:36:36	mrwonko	hey, how come the top of this compiles, but the bottom doesn't? https://play.golang.org/p/8eiNxWGzCD
2016-09-02 22:36:50	mohae_	I mean SAP implementations used to almost kill the enterprise and would fall short of initial goals and those are a fraction of the type of projects that would be necessary to do what you are talking about
2016-09-02 22:37:07	pestle	mrwonko, what type is SR?
2016-09-02 22:37:16	pestle	sorry, SL
2016-09-02 22:37:19	mrwonko	it's included

2016-09-02 22:37:35	pestle	CSC people?
2016-09-02 22:37:39	mrwonko	pestle: effectively a slice of S
2016-09-02 22:37:48	pestle	mrwonko, rather, in the `range SR {}` part, is SR a type or a value?

2016-09-02 22:38:19	mrwonko	don't worry. I don't see why it would be a value, it's supposed to be a type.
2016-09-02 22:38:37	Tv`	mrwonko: the parser sees for ... range SL { body_of_range_here }
2016-09-02 22:39:02	pestle	mrwonko, yeah.  nevermind me.  I need some coffee.  I'm not reading your code correctly.

In this rare case, the opening brace of the literal
2016-09-02 22:48:08	Tv`	is erroneously parsed as the one introducing the block of statements. To resolve the ambiguity, the composite literal must appear within parentheses."

2016-09-04 10:59:45	snappy	I have a c=net.UDPConn and f=io.ReadWriter. I want to poll (c,f) for i/o events, and handle accordingly. So in C and depending on OS this is accomplished using select, poll, epoll, kqueue, etc. But I'm pretty sure this is meant to be abstracted by channels in Go. Would the idea be to use goroutines to do blocking reads from the socket/io and when available send the data over channels which other parts of the

2016-09-04 13:51:30	foozboar	in the pasted example, do experience go-programmers prefer Sqrt_iter or Sqrt_rec..

2016-09-04 13:55:10		nisabek (~nisabek@ip5f5bebd4.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) has joined #go-nuts
2016-09-04 13:55:26	teaspoon	I think readability is similar enough in these specific examples that I'd go with the iter because it's smaller.
2016-09-04 13:57:17	teaspoon	But there would be situations (tree traversal's the classic example) where recursion makes a big readability impact so there's no convention against recursion.
2016-09-04 13:57:18	pestle	afaik, the gc compiler does not support tail-call optimization.  so iteration is greatly preferred over recursion.

2016-09-04 18:26:14	snappy	I don't know much about JS but in PHP you don't have strong typing which will bite you in the arse. So PHP would treat string representation of integers as actual integers, e.g. "55" + "10" == "65", which makes things easy (no need to convert), but usually undesired behaviour.
2016-09-04 18:30:08	snappy	And I guess the PHP approach is to use regular expressions where possible to split up the data. You can do that in Go, but REs are usually the wrong tool for a parsing problem, and slow.

When I do {{ . }} I only see the values, not the name of the members… could anyone tell me how I can have some meaningful introspection information with go-template?

2016-09-04 22:24:58	droyo	lumo_e: what specifically happens when you run this?
2016-09-04 22:25:09	droyo	i see this is an incomplete program
2016-09-04 22:25:13	lumo_e	yes it is not complete
2016-09-04 22:25:17	lumo_e	it's just a snippet
2016-09-04 22:25:23	lumo_e	that thing is inside the main()
2016-09-04 22:25:26	lumo_e	to give context
2016-09-04 22:25:44	droyo	what's happening for you to say it isn't working at all?
2016-09-04 22:25:45	lumo_e	droyo: basically the program exits before the goroutines have finished
2016-09-04 22:25:48	droyo	ok

2016-09-04 22:30:17	lumo_e	in the goroutine I'm blocking on that channel
2016-09-04 22:30:28	lumo_e	so in case it is blocked, wg.Done() wouldn't be called
2016-09-04 22:30:37	lumo_e	because it is after the for loop that blocks the Analyze

2016-09-04 22:30:45	lumo_e	this is why I am puzzled

2016-09-11 22:34:50	dbkaplun	i'm just wondering if there's a way to move the logic in walk() into Walk()

2016-09-11 22:39:12	dbkaplun	you're right that writing another walk() function and using it in Walk() is implementing the walk function
2016-09-11 22:39:16	dbkaplun	but i think there's a way to do it with just one function
2016-09-11 22:39:22	mohae	dbkaplun: but it's always good to experiment; try out alternatives.  Even if you don't achieve your goal, you'll learn something
2016-09-11 22:39:25	mohae	dbkaplun: there is, it's just more complicated
2016-09-11 22:39:48	dbkaplun	so that's what i'm working on now, and that's what i'm asking about
2016-09-11 22:39:54	mohae	dbkaplun: hint: you need to figure out when your exiting the root and close the channel then
2016-09-11 22:40:05	_jd	dbkaplun: you can store walk func in a local variable
2016-09-11 22:40:10	dbkaplun	yes, i know
2016-09-11 22:40:10	mohae	dbkaplun: right, and I provided the above hint last night to help you achieve your goal

2016-09-14 22:03:25	rgoodwin	Hey all...newbie question, sort of about Go, sort of about web.go (or other frameworks). Can I serve up a basic static html page (yes), then poll a remote api (yes), then serve up a redirect to another page to the browser w/o user having to refresh the browser? Not sure which layer this question actually relates to, but trying to see if this can be done w/o adding javascript to the mix. Thanks for any and all ideas :)

2016-09-15 09:00:37	Siegfried	slice/array thingamabooble is reference
2016-09-15 09:00:38	Vendan	still no
2016-09-15 09:00:40	pestle	Siegfried, the answer is no.
2016-09-15 09:00:41	Tv`	Siegfried: now try appending an item
2016-09-15 09:00:43	pestle	Siegfried, slices of []T are essentially values similar to a struct of type `struct { backing *T; slen,scap int };`
2016-09-15 09:01:07	Siegfried	I see so slices are structs?
2016-09-15 09:01:09	Vendan	a = append(a, 1) wouldn't affect the other side
2016-09-15 09:01:10	pestle	append() can change the backing array.

2016-09-15 09:04:42	pestle	Siegfried, I wouldn't go around assuming that.  the current compiler treats slices that way, but future ones might have a more complex view.  the spec gives some flexibility here.  what you need to know is (a) a slice is a window into backing array, (b) multiple slices can have windows into the same array, (c) append() can change the backing array of the slice (so it's no longer shared with other slices)

2016-09-15 14:44:55	_jd	I don't see that in this code snippet
2016-09-15 14:45:45	thanasisk	yeah it is an very stripped down version, my question is very specific: if i don't do select on the channel, the program "freezes"
2016-09-15 14:46:04	thanasisk	so is select on a channel the way to go? you guys mentioned data loss so what is the right way?
2016-09-15 14:46:21	_jd	thanasisk: your programme freezes cause you are writting to a channel and spinning a worker after that action
2016-09-15 14:46:36	_jd	What is happening when you write to unbuffered channel?
2016-09-15 14:47:08	thanasisk	it waits

2016-09-15 19:55:45	wI2L	Hi. I am writing a simple encoder, and i am looking forward for a good solution to reuse memory. The encode marshals the data, and then write it to n output stream. Since the marshaling process can return an error, i cache everything before writing to the output. Actually I am using a simple byt
2016-09-15 19:56:06	wI2L	a simple byte array created each time i need to encode something.

2016-09-17 07:34:28	porjo	I have a infinite loop with a select. First case is reading from a channel, then a default case. I'm finding that cpu usage is high due to the default case being hit too often. My first thought was to introduce a sleep which helped, but feels wrong. Wondering if there's a better approach?

2016-09-17 07:51:00	spotter	I'm trying to write some gocode that has a plugin interface, i.e. init function per package that registers itself with a lookup package.  I can't seem to figure out how to get them to all compile/link together as the "plugins" aren't directly referenced by the code I'm writing
2016-09-17 07:51:15	spotter	what's the proper way to do this?

2016-09-24 22:30:32	_jd	in general you wouldn't simply do a return in C as well, you would use exit or _exit, depending on the use case (at least on unix)

2016-09-24 22:53:08	elliotf	Hello folks.   I'm trying to get started learning go and am attempting to write my first test. I was reading through hugo's source to get a feed of how to do it and was specifically reading  https://github.com/spf13/hugo/blob/master/source/file_test.go and it does not explicitly include file.go in the same directory.  I attempted to reproduce this but the test does not find the struct that I'm exporting from the file.go ..  What is the ma
2016-09-24 22:53:09	elliotf	gic that I'm missing?
2016-09-24 22:53:51	elliotf	I have tried running `go test` and `go vendor test +local` and a few other things.  I'm pushing my code up to avoid having to describe what I have so far.
2016-09-24 22:54:32	_jd	elliotf: Not really the best way to learn go. I would recommend starting with a tour and effective go
2016-09-24 22:55:36	elliotf	_jd, I've read through to tour and can write go without having go-fmt complain at everything I write.  :)  I'm now trying to learn how to write tests
2016-09-24 22:55:53	elliotf	_jd, did I miss a section on how to test in the go tour?
