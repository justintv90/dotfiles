2016-09-02 17:01:01	fbt	smirky, are you slow or something. Yes, your question is stupid because scripts written for bash won't work under zsh qyute often
2016-09-02 17:01:02	ShapeShifter499	phillid: the example has the script being put in /etc/systemd/system

2016-09-02 23:07:56	yosinof	 be deleted and I also deleted ~/.config/modem-manager-gui, but when I installed again the same problem.. Is there any other way to delete and app and all of its config files?

Why  and how to show the real new content size of /dev/sdx1 (/ without /var) ?

2016-09-03 16:47:07	jeromelanteri	i do construct the partition, then use rsync for copy all files contained from initial /var, then mount new /dev/sdx4 on /var, then copy back on new /var the files from rsync
2016-09-03 16:47:17	jeromelanteri	(exactly like that)
2016-09-03 16:47:41	jeromelanteri	MrElendig, and the size of partition i see is from command "df"
2016-09-03 16:48:20	MrElendig	so you never actually deleted the data from the old /var
2016-09-03 16:48:21	jeromelanteri	df show me the new /var with good size (1.8Gb), but still have full /dev/sdx1
2016-09-03 16:48:37	jeromelanteri	MrElendig, yes, exactly. But how to do that now ?
2016-09-03 16:49:30	MrElendig	umount /var so that it isn't masked then use rm
2016-09-03 16:49:30	jeromelanteri	i can not unmount /dev/sdx4 (/var)

2016-09-03 21:33:32	grawity	afaik, ARM has more dependences on stuff like cross-compilation, oddball boot mechanisms, premade images
2016-09-03 21:33:58	Scimmia	and lots and lots of kernels
2016-09-03 21:33:59	grawity	hopefully not as many as previously, but yeah, I guess that too
2016-09-03 21:34:02	grawity	wasn't devicetree supposed to fix that?
2016-09-03 21:34:12	irreleph4nt	ponyrider: what I meant is, why is arm considered differently than 32bit and 64bit? The latter two are looked at as simply being ArchLinux, are they not?

2016-09-03 21:34:41	grawity	irreleph4nt: it's considered different because all the extra arm stuff is maintained by completely different people

2016-09-03 21:58:35	Son_Goku	the kernel folks have done a great job attempting to unify the ARM support, but the ARM folks are not making it easy to keep it that way
2016-09-03 21:58:55	peterpacz1	Cya folks. have a nice day. Thanks for allowing me to share my happiness :)

2016-09-03 21:59:30	NicoHood	Scimmia: nah. you missunderstood. sometimes the underlying arch really doesnt matter. and here you get normally a faster (or even at all) an answer. that doesnt hurt. however you should not ask raspi bootloader questions here. or at least clarify it. I always say that I am in the wrong channel then. but maybe someone listens more here. Like I personally also do
2016-09-03 21:59:31	Scimmia	petejones, not a white lie, a lie designed to take advantage of well intentioned people

What I am doing here however is venting my anger on how intransparent and therefore inefficient for an outsider (!) it is to be told off by a support group that for an outsider (!) is not clearly distinct from what he is currently wqorking with
2016-09-03 21:59:45	Son_Goku	and then the phone makers screwed that up

2016-09-03 21:59:50	phrik	NicoHood: This channel is for Arch Linux support only. Most Arch-based distros have fundamental differences and are served by their respective communities.
2016-09-03 22:00:04	Scimmia	NicoHood, do NOT tell people to lie to us. Period
2016-09-03 22:00:10	petejones	Scimmia: i was just kidding.
2016-09-03 22:00:23	NicoHood	Scimmia: I think you understood my intention 
2016-09-03 22:00:31	NicoHood	i aggree ;)
2016-09-03 22:00:34	Son_Goku	led by Qualcomm, they've introduced AArch64 systems that don't use UEFI or ACPI
2016-09-03 22:00:46	Scimmia	NicoHood, if you're telling people to get alarm support here, then no, I didn't
2016-09-03 22:00:57	Son_Goku	Red Hat and SUSE have been fighting back at it, and led by AMD and Linaro, they've been pushing back against it
2016-09-03 22:01:09	Son_Goku	but Qualcomm + Ubuntu tends to win a lot of battles :(
2016-09-03 22:01:33	petejones	irreleph4nt: it is distinct! thats what everyones been telling you man. its distinctly different. thats why its another distro, thats why its another irc. thats all.
2016-09-03 22:01:56	Son_Goku	so now the AArch64 / ARM64 situation is as messed up as 32-bit ARM arches before it

2016-09-04 08:21:48	hemosphere	otherwise, raid 0

2016-09-04 08:23:19	IQubic	I am aware. I am fine using it in chroot, but my DE requires I use NetworkManager.
2016-09-04 08:23:35	sheep	why does your DE require it?
2016-09-04 08:23:54	sheep	I know of people who use gnome and KDE without networkmanager
2016-09-04 08:23:57	IQubic	Not sure. That's just how Deepin was made.
2016-09-04 08:24:39	IQubic	I use the Deepin DE and the wiki say that in order to getr the build in network administration tools to work, I need NetworkManager.
2016-09-04 08:24:43	sorin-mihai	hemosphere, 16MB cache on both. seagate ST500LM021 on sda and ST500LT012 on sdb
2016-09-04 08:25:19	hemosphere	no matter the model/make, just has to have exact same specs or can be rigged to perform the same
2016-09-04 08:25:27	hemosphere	that's your bottom line issue with raids

2016-09-04 08:26:00	hemosphere	i still suggest you bench mark them
2016-09-04 08:26:08	jA_cOp	IQubic, they only conflict if you start them both at once. That said, NetworkManager has nmcli for working from the command line. How are you connected to the Internet right now, though? Just download whatever .pkg you need, move into the offline system, then install it with pacman -U thefile.pkg.tar.gz
2016-09-04 08:26:09	hemosphere	well, if they spin differently, you will have issues at the end of the day
2016-09-04 08:26:35	IQubic	So, even after deleting the file associated with my network's profile, and recreating the profile, I'm told that the profile either does not exist, or is not avalible.

2016-09-04 08:34:45	sorin-mihai	ok... so i want to encrypt both disks, and thinking to add lvm on each one, on top of luks, using the 1st one as main/os disk since it seems faster, and use 2nd one as spare space or backup. not sure if i should make a single lvm pool, or two. raid would complicate things since they aren't the same speed anyway

2016-09-04 10:07:45	hemosphere	given the mechanics of windows domains, it requires the OS to be on the domain(which I get) it's how the domain user crosses from it's login on the system, to the vnc/rdp server

2016-09-04 10:26:28	homerj	and naturally people picked the project over nvidia
2016-09-04 10:26:28	notadrop	oh okay.
2016-09-04 10:26:28	notadrop	I found an article aobut it on phoronix
2016-09-04 10:26:28	notadrop	about*
2016-09-04 10:26:28	hemosphere	and yet scada is doing better than opencl
2016-09-04 10:26:28	homerj	and it's the worst kind of argument too
2016-09-04 10:27:02	notadrop	well, honestly, I kind of agree with the Wayland folks, from what I just read
2016-09-04 10:27:05	homerj	technical, where Wayland is more "right" than nvidia is, but that doesn't really help their main goal of getting people to use Wayland
2016-09-04 10:27:10	hemosphere	link to their arguement notadrop

2016-09-04 10:27:22	ThreeGen	Wayland is too buggy to catch on as a replacement.

2016-09-04 10:28:08	notadrop	ThreeGen, so GNOME crashing in Wayland all the time isn't GNOME's fault?
2016-09-04 10:28:09	tigrmesh	homerj: find some other way to say "worst thing ever"?  
2016-09-04 10:28:12	tigrmesh	also
2016-09-04 10:28:21	ThreeGen	I assume not. Considering it isn't even gnome crashing, it's performance, no?
2016-09-04 10:28:31	notadrop	I've never heard anyone really mention wayland's bugs... I've just heard good things about it, like how it's more secure. one app can't capture all keystrokes and the entire screen, like they can on X
2016-09-04 10:28:37	ThreeGen	Same bugs a year later. I don't know who's to blame, but I don't care. It doesn't work.
2016-09-04 10:28:43	tigrmesh	is anyone here looking for support for arch linux?

2016-09-04 10:29:00	hemosphere	notadrop: you can mitigate that with firejail
2016-09-04 10:29:00	ThreeGen	I had an R9 270X, on Mesa, Gnome, and rending icons made it slow down to about 5fps.
2016-09-04 10:29:12	notadrop	hemosphere, yeah I use firejail for some apps, like IRC and my browser
2016-09-04 10:29:17	hemosphere	or xauth
2016-09-04 10:29:23	ThreeGen	That was like....a month ago. Same as a year ago.

2016-09-04 13:23:29	jeromelanteri	for uuid, if using grub, you also need to change a config of grub to be able to see it working fine. see the wiki around grub.
2016-09-04 13:23:31	duo8	apparently it's incorrect? how do i find the correct one?
2016-09-04 13:23:38	hemosphere	is it possible that the uuid was encrypted to?
2016-09-04 13:23:45	jeromelanteri	my config does boot from uuid with grub and it's fine

2016-09-04 13:24:41	ponyrider	it was sysx1000 ... so i should just send him to #gentoo or something?
2016-09-04 13:24:41	duo8	do i use the uuid or partuuid?

2016-09-04 13:24:58	duo8	for the cryptdevice?
2016-09-04 13:25:04	ponyrider	uuid. or even better, just put the /dev/sda because it works
2016-09-04 13:25:26	polyzen	that's not better than using the UUID
2016-09-04 13:25:44	polyzen	because if the drive order changes, it won't work
2016-09-04 13:25:46	jeromelanteri	ponyrider, it works if you have all the time the same order of boot devices, if you add one device and failed the order, it will failed. uuid from far is the best way to boot from partitions
2016-09-04 13:25:48	tigrmesh	sorry.  didn't see you were responding to someone, ponyrider

2016-09-04 13:26:52	ponyrider	jeromelanteri: yeah but i thought the reasoning for a uuid was to be able to recognise block devices without worrying about order
2016-09-04 13:27:07	jeromelanteri	ponyrider, yes sure.uuid is unik id
2016-09-04 13:27:37	tigrmesh	unique?

2016-09-04 13:29:36	ponyrider	just saying that with my bootloader, UUIDs dont register. its not GRUB either.

2016-09-04 13:30:31	jeromelanteri	ponyrider, let me have a look on wiki for you on that uuid point
2016-09-04 13:30:36	Bunk	no, for creating a multibootstick ( grub4dos and easy2boot )
2016-09-04 13:31:09	tigrmesh	i don't know
2016-09-04 13:31:13	Bunk	It used commands to put a mbr on the stick, then cloned the files needed directly.
2016-09-04 13:31:20	jeromelanteri	Bunk, maybe with command line dd
2016-09-04 13:31:28	sysx1000	I understand that it's not supported, but I am pretty sure, that someone would use it and this channel wouldn't be an exception ;) I suppose, that #gentoo won't help be, because my case is OpenRC on archlinux, neither OpenRC on Gentoo nor OpenRC in itself
2016-09-04 13:32:10	tigrmesh	did you say something about manjaro?
2016-09-04 13:32:16	ponyrider	sysx1000: but they would generally use openrc. systemd is default on arch, and most people would use it

2016-09-04 14:27:56	mlq	That should be the case since I'm reproducing it with a small program that just allocated blocks of memory every few seconds 
2016-09-04 14:28:06	mlq	and never accesses it again
2016-09-04 14:29:31	phillid	Is it actually using the memory?
2016-09-04 14:29:44	phillid	plain malloc won't cause swapping
2016-09-04 14:29:50	mlq	The documentation of vm.swappiness says that it configures the 'aggressivness' of swapping; so if I set it to 100 it should start swapping very fast. However, even if I pause the allocation program, it does not start swapping out and the system is pretty much idle the whole time. The main issue is that when I am using the computer normally (browser, mail, etc) and this happens it just freezes and I almost
2016-09-04 14:29:51	mlq	never gain back control of it and have to force reboot it
2016-09-04 14:29:51	Murray_B	Okay, I solved the problem by just recompiling the game, guess I should file a bug for it.

2016-09-04 15:29:37	James123	I have a problem with dbus-related. In my .xinitrc, I have " eval $(dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session) ". DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS seems to export correctly. But when I try to launch a program that needs dbus, e.g. Cantata, it does not start. I have to manually rerun the eval $(dbus-launch... line for it to work. Any ideas?

2016-09-04 16:12:53	kabads	sshow: this is assuming you have access to the man file (which will be available upstream). The problem with running it from a package is that you get the whole package. Which is what package managers do. 
2016-09-04 16:13:35	seventh__	deltasquared : I am asking this - because while playing a game the ^ stroke doesn't get recognized.... 
2016-09-04 16:13:37	sshow	deltasquared, kabads; thanks. I'll let you know if I make something smart
2016-09-04 16:14:20	mxfm	OK, so the problem is "hpet1: lost rtc interrupts" message which appears every 3 - 5 minutes. I have noticed it several days ago. I don't see any other issues in dmesg log which may explain lost rtc interrupts.
2016-09-04 16:14:28	deltasquared	sshow: reminds me of an idea I had a while back, of turning the bits of packages into filesystem images and mounting them directly, then using a shitton of bind mounts to produce a working root fs
2016-09-04 16:14:51	deltasquared	mxfm: do you think it's causing any breaking issues?
2016-09-04 16:15:01	sshow	deltasquared, it's an interesting idea.

2016-09-04 16:15:47	deltasquared	mxfm AFAIK the kernel falls back to other stuff if the HPET breaks, so if nothing else goes awry and no fix is findable it may be ignorable

2016-09-04 16:16:06	sshow	deltasquared, with virtual home directory then? or how would it differ from a package install except from creating mounts?
2016-09-04 16:16:37	mxfm	OK, what is HPET anyway? I didn't find information on it.
2016-09-04 16:16:47	deltasquared	sshow: no need to extract packages, just throw images onto a drive (even onto FAT32 from *gasp* windows) and boot images, and start up

2016-09-04 17:18:05	Mathisen	morning, i have been strugling with an anoying issue.. when my screen locks, everytime i come back the TV that i have connected with HDMI as second screen start to make noise sounds... i cant figure out why.. to make it stop i need to go to sound settings in cinnamon that i am using and "test sound" on HDMI displayport2 
2016-09-04 17:18:20	Mathisen	can anyone figure out how i can make this stop ?

2016-09-04 17:19:17	deltasquared	it reminds me of something my phone does... when the sound chip turned off in powersave mode, it started making clicks
2016-09-04 17:19:35	deltasquared	if it played sound it would be silent after it stopped for a while
2016-09-04 17:19:51	deltasquared	it may just be line noise that isn't compensated when it goes into said powersave mode

2016-09-04 18:13:18	Luyin	hi everyone, I'm trying to connect with my usb-3g-stick as by this wiki article: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_3G_Modem I can see the stick in my connections https://paste.xinu.at/MfZqX/ but if I click on it, I don't get connected. journalctl shows me this: https://paste.xinu.at/hpkxFg/ what do I have to do? I think I might be missing something.

2016-09-15 07:48:35	sheep	is that a user unit or a system unit?
2016-09-15 07:48:48	victoroux	user, i made it myself
2016-09-15 07:48:55	victoroux	shall i share those as well?
2016-09-15 07:49:02	sheep	no, it's system.
2016-09-15 07:49:53	victoroux	oh, i'm new to systemd -- i figured since i wrote it it'd be user
2016-09-15 07:49:53	sheep	/etc/systemd/system has system units. you want to put it in a user directory
2016-09-15 07:49:53	victoroux	well i figured anyone on the system can use this unit, so i put it in the former
2016-09-15 07:49:53	sheep	also, does this need access to an X server? if so, you need to export the DISPLAY environment variable for it
2016-09-15 07:49:53	victoroux	but since it is my user name in ther,e i'll move it haha
2016-09-15 07:50:35	sheep	you could make it a user unit and it would still be available to all users
2016-09-15 07:50:35	sheep	but it should run per-user rather than system-wide
2016-09-15 07:50:35	victoroux	oh i see
2016-09-15 07:50:35	sheep	what does this service do?
2016-09-15 07:51:03	victoroux	it reads a file that has xprintidle in it, if it's over 30s it tells another script to turn off the display
2016-09-15 07:55:53	victoroux	the script itself shouldn't require x server, right?
2016-09-15 07:55:53	victoroux	if it's calling other scripts
2016-09-15 07:55:53	victoroux	idk..
2016-09-15 07:55:53	sheep	how does the other script turn off the display?
2016-09-15 07:55:53	victoroux	xset s activate
2016-09-15 07:55:53	sheep	that needs X
2016-09-15 07:55:53	victoroux	yea, the child script does
2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	so the entire thing does.
2016-09-15 07:55:54	victoroux	bummer :(

2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	something has to pass the DISPLAY variable to the child, or it has to have some way to determine it
2016-09-15 07:55:54	RudyValencia	blackslab, alyptik: AD-synced users don't get a DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or XDG_SESSION_ID and these seem to be what keeps AD users from signing in
2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	it might make more sense to start the script in the background from your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xprofile since it needs X context to run
2016-09-15 07:55:54	victoroux	i've added DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment variables and it's the same message
2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	how did you add them>
2016-09-15 07:55:54	alyptik	oo

2016-09-15 07:55:54	victoroux	so the way this script works, it sets the soft display off, and runs another script in the background stopping this service while that runs

2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	that might work if your user only ever has display :0. but you also need to get the service to run as your user
2016-09-15 07:55:54	victoroux	hm, i can try changing root to my username, but then how can i send a sudo command in a script?
2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	you shouldn't do that

2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	you can change the user that a systemd unit runs as with the User parameter
2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	you don't need to do that if you make it a user unit instead of a system unit though
2016-09-15 07:55:54	victoroux	right, that's what i mean -- won't that affect the script that it exec=?
2016-09-15 07:55:54	sheep	yes
2016-09-15 07:55:54	victoroux	oh lol, i'll just move the file then
2016-09-15 07:56:21	victoroux	it was ~/.local/systemd/system? 
2016-09-15 07:56:48	sheep	~/.config/systemd/user

Local users are able to log in on the console, via ssh and via X. Why could this be happening and how do I resolve it?

2016-09-15 17:21:37	MrElendig	you are not making any sense
2016-09-15 17:21:37	MrElendig	dhcp and static are contradicting

2016-09-15 17:22:53	mongy	*sigh*. so I can't have a different wireless network switch to dhcp?

2016-09-15 17:24:05	MrElendig	networkmanager is the easiest way to deal with multiple wifi networks
2016-09-15 17:24:05	mongy	no thanks!

2016-09-15 22:41:04	MacGyver	You may need to change the way a deletion is handled.
2016-09-15 22:41:25	MacGyver	I.e. instead of deleting the file and propagating to gmail, you have to use IMAP deletion mechanisms explicitly.
2016-09-15 22:41:46	MacGyver	So flag for deletion, then purge.
2016-09-15 22:42:10	MacGyver	https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892?hl=en implies that.

2016-09-17 07:38:05	_7z	Hi
2016-09-17 07:38:17	Raku	Run glxinfo | grep OpenGL
2016-09-17 07:38:20	Raku	And put that in a bin
2016-09-17 07:38:25	Raku	Please dont use pastebin

2016-09-24 16:11:37	Cheesenacho	so I create the folder first, and then use the mount command?

2016-09-24 16:18:52	tbo	Cheesenacho: is it /dev/sda?
2016-09-24 16:19:13	Cheesenacho	I believe so...when I ran the ls command I see 3 drives, and sda is the 1TB drive I am trying to get on line.

2016-09-24 22:06:33	MacGyver	Not really, because what you're checking is what gets sent back to you over the intertubes, so if the check fails it *might* be a transmission error.
