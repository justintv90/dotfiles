2016-09-02 09:29:34	Elec_A_	Hi, my question is a bit odd, but when someone tells you a memory of his dad (I mean a story of what he did) when he was alive, what would you say? "What a nice memory"? "What a great story?" "God bless him"? or what ?

2016-09-02 11:39:00	^peter^	Safer to use the generic doctor
2016-09-02 11:39:37	C3aa	so just "doctor"?

2016-09-03 21:53:20	unholycrab	a mutation is sometimes like an iterative change
2016-09-03 21:54:03	unholycrab	or a grotesque change
2016-09-03 21:54:26	unholycrab	its more descriptive i think, than "change"
2016-09-03 21:54:29	Ox0dea	His initially saying "mutable" leads me to assume it's a programming question, in which case "mutate" tends to connote that some object is being changed "in-place".

2016-09-04 08:01:50	athenes19	Bassett's Traditional Winegums... have completely changed.
2016-09-04 08:02:05	Skunky	they're no long traditional?
2016-09-04 08:02:05	athenes19	They are inedible now from having been the top #1 candy in the world.
2016-09-04 08:02:32	athenes19	They have the audacity to call them "Bassett's Traditional Winegums" still, in spite of it being a completely different (and disgusting-tasting) candy now.
2016-09-04 08:02:50	athenes19	I heard about this what feels like several years ago, but only now noticed it.
2016-09-04 08:02:58	athenes19	Before, they must have had a large stock.
2016-09-04 08:03:12	athenes19	Of the old version.
2016-09-04 08:03:44	athenes19	The new one cannot even be compared to the old. It's like they... removed anything that made it good.
2016-09-04 08:04:00	athenes19	And changed the feeling, color, taste, aftertaste, ingredients...
2016-09-04 08:04:11	Skunky	and replaced it with something that looks the same, but that's the only thing that's the same besides the name?
2016-09-04 08:04:21	athenes19	Yes.
2016-09-04 08:04:38	athenes19	And even if you don't care about the old version (for some reason), this new version is not even good tasting as a general candy.
2016-09-04 08:04:59	athenes19	As if they went out of their way to ruin a very established and beloved brand.
2016-09-04 08:05:36	Skunky	there seems to be a lot of that going around.
2016-09-04 08:06:04	athenes19	I have noticed it on other candies as well, that used to taste and look completely different.
2016-09-04 08:06:25	athenes19	Whenever I see a little star that says "NEW AND IMPROVE RECIPE!" on any food product, I know I'll no longer be able to buy it.
2016-09-04 08:06:35	athenes19	*IMPROVED

2016-09-04 17:05:14	light	ANJ7: It does make one think of film/theatre.
2016-09-04 17:05:51	Kurolox	I have a question about how "nor" must be used. I'm not a native speaker and I tend to use it as a replacement for "or" when the sentence is being negated (Example: That program is not in alpha nor beta). I believe that my usage of nor is wrong, though.)
2016-09-04 17:06:31	stravaiger	ANJ7, How about MG Creations?
2016-09-04 17:06:32	cybrNaut	indeed, i thought it was a film producer.. but that's MGM I think.  they have a vegas casino

2016-09-04 17:39:30	stravaiger	ANJ7, is that company name MG Creations (you spell it differently)? If so, then it may be a problem. It depends on where that company is registered, and where it does business - perhaps also the kind of business it does. These are complex questions, especially in an international context. You would need to tak advice from a lawyer / patent attorney.

2016-09-04 21:00:34	crazycoder	when to use "until" "till"
2016-09-04 21:00:36	crazycoder	same thing ?
2016-09-04 21:00:49	crazycoder	i have to create a field of my database table
2016-09-04 21:00:56	crazycoder	i shoul dname it locked_till
2016-09-04 21:01:01	crazycoder	or
2016-09-04 21:01:01	crazycoder	locked_until
2016-09-04 21:06:39	Guess59061	crazycoder: The formal way includes the ‘until’ variant.
2016-09-04 21:06:56	crazycoder	so calling a field "locked_until"
2016-09-04 21:06:56	crazycoder	makes sense?
2016-09-04 21:08:24	stravaiger	It makes the precisely same sense as locked_till, but is more elegant. Of course it begs the question, "until when?",  but presumably your code answers that.
2016-09-04 21:08:55	crazycoder	stravaiger, yes it is a datetime type
2016-09-04 21:09:02	crazycoder	so i have the date there
2016-09-04 21:09:07	stravaiger	Then it is fine

Previously (in my time usage) a relative clause with might have elided parts but a question, as a whole sentence, would always have the subject and verb inverted. So "when you go" was usable as a relative clauses but not as a standalone question. rather for a stand-alone question, the verb has to go before the subjec

2016-09-04 23:02:14	kurahaupo	brahman: your problem here is that they have given you an exercise to change sentences into passive voice, but in this particular case you have a sentence with two verbs. It would generally be assumed that the "main" verb is the one to be restructured, but in this case it's the subordinate one that needs restructuring to read naturally

2016-09-15 06:12:13	RightReasonRhym_	They would tell you words like "read", "minute", "record", and "digest", and ask which one didn't have a meaning-dependent second pronunciation.
2016-09-15 06:12:39	RightReasonRhym_	Er, wait.
2016-09-15 06:12:40	RightReasonRhym_	Let me change the words.
2016-09-15 06:13:20	RightReasonRhym_	They would tell you words like "measure", "read", "minute", "record", and "digest", and ask which one didn't have a meaning-dependent second pronunciation.
2016-09-15 06:13:20	RightReasonRhym_	There.
2016-09-15 06:14:09	RightReasonRhym_	It's not trivial for someone who isn't a very advanced learner; it would strike people as odd that "digest" and "minute" have two pronunciations, for example.
2016-09-15 06:14:26	RightReasonRhym_	And they're both nouns, unlike common noun-verb pairs like "record".
2016-09-15 06:14:27	Guess59061	Hm.
2016-09-15 06:15:11	Guess59061	"Measure" doesn't have any other pronunciations.
2016-09-15 06:15:40	RightReasonRhym_	Yep, precisely.
2016-09-15 06:15:59	RightReasonRhym_	It's things that not even native speakers think about.
2016-09-15 06:16:31	RightReasonRhym_	You have MINute for a unit of time, and miNUte for something small; "a minute detail".
2016-09-15 06:16:52	RightReasonRhym_	And the pronunciation changes dramatically, not just in stressed syllable.
2016-09-15 06:17:21	Guess59061	Right. Like "minutiae".

2016-09-15 06:18:52	Guess59061	I can't... I just know it's different. I'd say it's faster haha.
2016-09-15 06:19:26	Guess59061	I've never heard it pronounced, I think.
2016-09-15 06:20:03	RightReasonRhym_	Basically, if it's a noun:  /ˈdʌɪdʒɛst/
2016-09-15 06:20:12	RightReasonRhym_	If it's a verb, /dʌɪˈdʒɛst/ 
2016-09-15 06:20:20	RightReasonRhym_	Here, the stressed syllable changes exclusively.
2016-09-15 06:20:20	Guess59061	Note that I pronounce "to digest" as "die-jest".
2016-09-15 06:20:25	Guess59061	Oh.
2016-09-15 06:20:31	RightReasonRhym_	No -- where is the stressed syllable.
2016-09-15 06:20:31	RightReasonRhym_	THAT is what changes.
2016-09-15 06:22:26	Guess59061	Now that I've heard both words pronounced, it makes sense.
2016-09-15 06:22:38	Guess59061	Well, kinda, idk.
2016-09-15 06:22:40	RightReasonRhym_	These very very finicky details are what separate C1 from C2.
2016-09-15 06:23:22	RightReasonRhym_	So understandably someone that knows this probably knows English at a decent level atleast.
2016-09-15 06:24:15	Guess59061	I would choose the correct answer... but I wouldn't know the difference between the noun and the verb.
2016-09-15 06:25:18	RightReasonRhym_	I think a good rule of thumb is, if there's a noun-verb pair, the noun gets the stressed syllable first, and the verb gets the second syllable stressed.
2016-09-15 06:26:03	Guess59061	RightReasonRhym_: Could you give me an example of that?
2016-09-15 06:26:24	RightReasonRhym_	You have one; DIgest (noun), diGEST (verb); REcord (noun); reCORD (verb)
2016-09-15 06:27:06	RightReasonRhym_	CONflict (noun); conFLICT (verb)
2016-09-15 06:27:15	Guess59061	Thank you.
2016-09-15 06:27:19	RightReasonRhym_	PERmit (noun); perMIT (verb)
2016-09-15 06:27:39	Guess59061	I see, that's how I intuited there indeed exists a difference without ever having heard the word pronounced.
2016-09-15 06:27:45	RightReasonRhym_	PROgress; proGRESS
2016-09-15 06:27:49	RightReasonRhym_	It's a good rule of thumb.
2016-09-15 06:28:09	RightReasonRhym_	Yes, and it exists for a reason: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial-stress-derived_noun
2016-09-15 06:28:39	RightReasonRhym_	It was done on purpose, I guess.

2016-09-24 21:48:57	jamietech	the one relevant for Tova: In AmE, one always speaks of the street on which an address is located, whereas in BrE in can also be used in some contexts. In suggests an address on a city street, so a service station (or a tourist attraction or indeed a village) would always be on a major road, but a department store might be in Oxford Street. Moreover if a particular place on the street is specified then the preposition used is
2016-09-24 21:48:57	jamietech	 whichever is idiomatic to the place, thus "at the end of Churchill Road."
