2016-09-02 20:49:44	vimgor	a project that helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems. (1 more message)

2016-09-03 20:54:56	vimgor	Binary Search Fault Localisation: Put the :finish keyword in the middle of your ~/.vimrc (but not inside a block, like: while, for, try and functions). This will disable the latter half of the file. Retest to see if your problem persists. If so then the problem is inside the still active half. Otherwise the problem is in the disabled half. Repeat with binary divisions as necessary. See bisectly

2016-09-04 12:52:05	joshsyn	dear vimmers, what plugins do you use for C++ or other languages editing especially when it comes to navigation?
2016-09-04 12:52:09	joshsyn	Navigating around has always been a showstopper for me to using vim
2016-09-04 12:52:29	joshsyn	I know few plugins like NerdTree, but do not know how to use it to do things like "Go to declaration of this word under cursor"
2016-09-04 12:52:43	joshsyn	I prefer a language agnostic tool to do so, I found CtrlP + ag really great, but just wondering if there are anything out there?
2016-09-04 12:52:56	joshsyn	looking for plugins or ideas for this kind of workflow

2016-09-04 12:59:35	reith	hi guys. I look for some method to help me autoindent lines broken function arugments according to pep8 and align them visually in python code.
2016-09-04 12:59:35	reith	please take a look at this https://bpaste.net/show/2f983b7e5200
2016-09-04 12:59:35	reith	i want when I press enter before second string, align that string just below first string with some key binding
2016-09-04 12:59:35	Guiri	Hmm. I use the pep8-indent plugin and just V + =
2016-09-04 12:59:35	reith	without manually guessing shift levels
2016-09-04 12:59:35	reith	Guiri: thanks, checking..
2016-09-04 12:59:36	Guiri	Most of the time..

2016-09-04 13:00:50	Guiri	What else does pymode offer that you like, out of curiosity?

2016-09-04 13:09:25	reith	I didn't tried Jedi myself (being used by YCM but I have no idea how is it) The minimal refactory capabalities of Rope make me feel a little better after I exprienced heavy and smart Java IDEs. And it feels good :)

2016-09-14 22:26:44	phy1729	vimgor: smartindent
2016-09-14 22:26:44	vimgor	Don't you mean stupidindent? In all seriousness, 'smartindent' is an obsolete option for C-like syntax. It has been replaced with 'cindent', and setting 'cindent' also overrides 'smartindent'. Vim has indentation support for many languages out-of-the-box, and setting 'smartindent' (or 'cindent', for that matter) in your .vimrc might interfere with this. Use 'filetype plugin indent on' and be happy.
2016-09-14 22:26:50	romainl	syntax enable is useless and syntax on should be *before* any "colorscheme" command

2016-09-15 07:50:35	Aelius	and it's at the end of the rc (which is processed linearly, right?)
2016-09-15 07:55:53	FireFly	Should be
2016-09-15 07:55:53	FireFly	Is it after the mapping is set? then it shouldn't matter
2016-09-15 07:55:53	FireFly	You could check if the mapping exists after starting vim, with  :map <C-l>
2016-09-15 07:55:54	FireFly	to know whether it's at all set
2016-09-15 07:55:54	Aelius	that being said, I tried the trick of adding :finish right before the Vundle bit (which is the last segment of my vimrc) and it solved the issue

2016-09-15 13:58:05	squiddy	I am facing this weird behavior, the solution to which I couldn't find online - I use zsh on iTerm2 (on El Capitan) and vim with the TabBar plugin. Sometimes when I quit vim, this happens http://pastebin.com/5nLipWSW. The key sequence of vim seems to appear on the terminal. If i try to scroll up or press enter, escape or delete, i see these sequences. What should I do to debug/fix this issue?

2016-09-15 15:37:17	devil_tux	it works with <C-g> for e.g. and thats fine
2016-09-15 15:37:17	mgedmin	ngWalrus: ah, interesting!  so is there a directory called 'syntastic.vim', or is the error message blatantly lying?
2016-09-15 15:37:51	mgedmin	ctrl-4 is the same thing as ctrl-\ in terminals and by default it sends SIGQUIT, which makes the current process dump core

2016-09-15 18:44:36	watersnorks	wushee: i got pretty far with cmder (based on conemu)

2016-09-15 18:44:37	wushee	i have two setups, one in bash/conemu and one in zsh/linux subsystem

See :help 'swb' for minor built-in relief, and https://github.com/dahu/TabMeIfYouCan for a weightier solution. Consider ':set hidden' as an alternative workflow.

2016-09-24 22:01:32	thebope	Hmm.. I remember one time I found a list of every color. For instance, currently NERDTree directories are in a dark blue, which is hard to read on a black background. There was a way to see how that variable was defined so I could set it to something different in my vimrc file

2016-09-24 22:52:29	lopid	if i wanted to define an autocmd that runs on filetype perl, i'd have to list all the perl file patterns (｢autocmd bufread *.pl,*.pm,etc…｣). is there no other way?
2016-09-24 22:53:14	ntnn	au FileType perl ?
2016-09-24 22:53:21	ntnn	or what do you want to achieve?

2016-09-24 22:53:58	ntnn	FileType au's and ftplugins run on filetype detection, so pretty much also on BufRead and BufNew...

2016-09-24 23:06:33	ntnn	viml is an interpreted language and the interpeter is vim, there is virtually no difference between viml running on 32bit machines vs viml running on 64bit
