2016-09-02 09:42:28	justintv90	Can you guys please describe about map function. For example: this.props.items.map(item, 2nd argument). I know the first argument will returns item of array but what is argument 2, is it the index of item ?
2016-09-02 09:42:39	justintv90	Thanks

2016-09-02 09:44:00	GreenJello	justintv90, the second argument to .map is what `this` will be in the callback. It isn't really needed anymore since we have arrow functions
2016-09-02 09:44:23	GreenJello	justintv90, the second argument to the function you *pass* to .map (the first argument of .map) is the index of the current item

2016-09-02 09:45:32	justintv90	let tasks = this.props.tasks.map((task, taskIndex) => (...)
2016-09-02 09:45:43	justintv90	to taskIndex will be index of the current task item ?
2016-09-02 09:45:48	GreenJello	yeah
2016-09-02 09:46:18	justintv90	Oh, thanks alot
2016-09-02 09:46:35	GreenJello	it's probably using it in a key prop, but if possible, use a unique id that's a property of task instead
2016-09-02 09:46:50	GreenJello	you can run into issues using the index as a key

2016-09-02 09:48:11	justintv90	You mean i should put an id key into the data model instead of using that 2nd argument method ?

2016-09-02 09:50:04	GreenJello	the index as key has issues when you do things like reorder the list, or delete or insert items into the middle

2016-09-02 11:19:02	cam_y	sometimes it gets ugly/weird to pass all these props down the nested components
2016-09-02 11:19:32	GreenJello	you can have containers rendered by non-container elements, it sometimes make sense
2016-09-02 11:20:07	cam_y	I thought the idea of state is that it is accessible to all components. I see in many cases this simplifies navigating code/debugging/ getting up a clean code.
2016-09-02 11:20:27	cam_y	is there any technical limitation if we don't use that patterns in some cases ?
2016-09-02 11:20:54	GreenJello	which pattern?

2016-09-02 11:38:37	brent__	Hello, i'm doing a rails backend w/ react/redux front end project. I have a button to redirect to another route via hashHistory.push, however after clicking it, it won't redirect until after the page i'm on's ajax get request finishes. So if I go to /feeds and immediately click the button to redirect me to /categories, it can take a second or 2 for the GET
2016-09-02 11:38:37	brent__	request fetchAllFeeds to complete,before it will redirect me to /categories

2016-09-02 17:24:19	GreenJello	Piyush, is the problem the network time or react rendering?
2016-09-02 17:24:33	Piyush	network is good
2016-09-02 17:24:40	GreenJello	how many items are in the list?
2016-09-02 17:25:16	Piyush	around 650
2016-09-02 17:25:33	Piyush	react is also rendering properly
2016-09-02 17:25:39	swahili	Q: I'm looking at the tests for React Toolbox and I don't know how this tests work because there's no assertions etc ? Does anyone what they're doing or how these are being tested ? As an example ( https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/blob/dev/spec/components/avatar.js )

2016-09-02 17:26:38	GreenJello	Piyush, pagination is one option, it'll give the best performance. If that's not cool with you, you can do the trick where you render just enough items to fill a screen, wait a little bit, and then render all of the items
2016-09-02 17:26:45	efdee	i guess it's the "if it doesn't blow up, that's great" kind of tests
2016-09-02 17:26:56	GreenJello	or you can go high tech and use an infinite scrolling library
2016-09-02 17:27:00	swahili	Is the test just to know if they render ?!

2016-09-02 17:28:15	GreenJello	swahili, it's probably for visual inspection which is a very important part, but you should also have other tests

2016-09-02 17:30:22	riku	if react-toolbox is purely UI components, that's the only test you need really

2016-09-02 20:57:59	Glenjamin	it might not do what you need, but it's code should show you how to
2016-09-02 20:58:15	gajus	at least that should be possible for that purpose.
2016-09-02 20:58:17	Glenjamin	yup, but reading someone else's code is easier than me explaining it here

2016-09-02 21:02:30	xtristan1	I have a redux store and react router and my untested assumption is that simply calling render() again on another mountpoint is the fast lane to sad town.  The page is templated via jinja2, then i have react for sub-navbar.  I do this so that the user sees some content before my JS payload is delivered/runs
2016-09-02 21:02:59	gajus	oh, yes, that would be a use case; when the entire app is not pure React app

2016-09-02 21:04:20	xtristan1	Yeah, for _reasons_ (mostly time and already written code) it's not feasible to go pure React or server-side render.  I have a search component that I want to put in my top nav, but that div is delivered by the templating engine, which is the rest of the story

2016-09-02 21:15:40	Glenjamin	mikename: i've done that, it's better than rebuilding from scratch
2016-09-02 21:15:49	Glenjamin	xtristan1: that should work fine
2016-09-02 21:15:58	mikename	specifically with fullcalendar or just in general?
2016-09-02 21:16:48	xtristan1	Glenjamin: oh, okay. i'll try just two different renders.  as mentioned, i was mostly concerned about react router and redux, but it's easy enough to test — i'll just have a #navbar_mount and a #body_mount.  Thanks again

2016-09-03 20:59:04	axilla	you can call functions, actions, etc
2016-09-03 20:59:16	axilla	ajax and get json data from an api endpoint
2016-09-03 20:59:28	axilla	componentWillMount happens before the component mounts

2016-09-03 22:18:59	dk0r	hmm, this article seems to indicate that that components should not be written w/ stateless/functional syntax when lifecycle methods (e.g. componentDidMount) are used:  http://buildwithreact.com/article/stateless-functional-components

2016-09-03 22:39:12	dk0r	thanks Glenjamin. So just use 'React.createClass()' then? Could 'extends React.Component{}' be used w/ lifecycle methods?

2016-09-04 11:41:32	GreenJello	iAmerikan, you usually want to wrap it in a function that passes information about which recipe it matches with
2016-09-04 11:41:50	GreenJello	e.g. removeRecipe={() => removerecipe(recipe.id)}; or pass the index to it
2016-09-04 11:43:23	iAmerikan	ah i see what you mean, let me give it a try. thanks

2016-09-04 21:05:35	aviraldg	Is there a better way to handle the situation where from a parent component you need to call a method on a child component, than creating a ref and creating a wrapper method in the parent that returns a default value if the ref isn't defined yet or calls through to the child?

2016-09-04 22:21:16	dk0r	anarchyrucks, you're unlikely to get help pasting that much code
2016-09-04 22:21:23	dk0r	use gist or something similar

2016-09-04 22:22:04	dk0r	skinux, sounds like you're starting a new project? You might consider generating a new project using the create-react-app tool and then 'ejecting' it in order to expose the webpack cfg and other dependencies
2016-09-04 22:22:17	skinux	No, create-react-app totally broke my app
2016-09-04 22:22:42	dk0r	skinux, you're having trouble importing React, so..
2016-09-04 22:22:50	anarchyrucks	i want to append the text in commentbox to the screen after i click post
2016-09-04 22:22:55	dk0r	there may be something else that is breaking your app :)
2016-09-04 22:23:06	skinux	dk0r: Using that tool isn't going to fix the problem.
2016-09-04 22:23:37	anarchyrucks	no problem with the code till now its working fine
2016-09-04 22:23:38	dk0r	skinux, idk --sounds like something is bjorked in your project's setup
2016-09-04 22:23:46	anarchyrucks	i dont know what to do next

2016-09-04 22:27:13	anarchyrucks	is it good to use jQuery and React together?
2016-09-04 22:27:51	dk0r	`good` ?
2016-09-04 22:29:07	anarchyrucks	thats difficult to explain
2016-09-04 22:29:10	anarchyrucks	haha
2016-09-04 22:29:23	dk0r	anarchyrucks, i've recently run into the same question myself. My impression is that jquery can be used w/ react however a lot of the commonly used jquery can be easily written in pure javascript
2016-09-04 22:29:25	skinux	https://github.com/skinuxgeek/candilog
2016-09-04 22:29:55	anarchyrucks	hmm okay
2016-09-04 22:29:59	dk0r	if you write javascript instead, that you can avoided loading/being dependent upon the jquery lib
2016-09-04 22:30:26	dk0r	someone mentioned that jquery greatly simplifies ajax calls tho (but I haven't used ajax, so idk)

2016-09-04 22:40:25	DeltaHeavy	jQuery is pointless these days IMO. It was useful when Web APIs were less developed than they are now, and there were tonnes of inconsistancies between browsers.

2016-09-04 22:42:53	ldev	jquery does have its use cases, but unfortunately people are using it do anything JS, and that right that prevents you from actually learning how things work.

2016-09-14 22:27:48	tga	quick check, do you install webpack globally or shrinkwrap it for every project?
2016-09-14 22:27:48	samssh	Huh. I wasn't able to get ide-flow to work for me most of the time. I installed Nuclide (what I have now), but it turns out they don't support Atom 1.9 yet. :P
2016-09-14 22:27:57	tga	webstorm likes typescript
2016-09-14 22:28:31	chenghiz	i install webpack for every project, since CI needs it to build anyway
2016-09-14 22:29:05	GreenJello	also keep in mind that shrinkwrap doesn't include dev deps by default
2016-09-14 22:29:24	tga	wrong use of the term I guess, I meant having multiple projects with different versions
2016-09-14 22:29:33	tga	chenghiz: that's a good reason
2016-09-14 22:29:52	GreenJello	but global installs are for cli tools that can be used in places where npm and node aren't used
2016-09-14 22:30:18	tga	I'm asking because I saw mentions that you shouldn't install typescript locally, only globally
2016-09-14 22:30:31	GreenJello	huh I wonder why that'd be
2016-09-14 22:30:56	GreenJello	I'd install it in both if I wanted to use it in arbitrary places and also as part of the build system
2016-09-14 22:31:10	tga	Including typescript as an npm dependency : node_modules/typescript/ This means that all of typescript gets included .... there is an implicitly included lib.d.ts in your project anyway
2016-09-14 22:31:44	tga	typings pain, I hate it because I don't fully understand how it works
2016-09-14 22:31:44	tga	so atm I can't reason about all the type problems I'm getting

When I click the button on a row I get either a 0 or 1 back in regards to the ID, that is working.  what I want to do, is depending on the 0 or 1, change the button.  I can get it so all the buttons change, but I want row by row

2016-09-15 17:43:59	tga	so if instead of a whole app you had a small widget, it would work the same
2016-09-15 17:44:23	tga	and you could call the function as many times as needed, on different nodes

2016-09-15 22:16:07	jumpman	unsure
2016-09-15 22:16:38	jumpman	i'm working on two apps currently that have a problem that might or might not be similar -- each of them needs to handle state without sticking to the conventional react "have the parent component handle it" pattern
2016-09-15 22:16:38	jumpman	so I use redux and redux-saga on those
2016-09-15 22:16:57	zyrolasting	Right. My problem is that one component handles pointer events, but delegates processing to a whole different component via a factory
2016-09-15 22:17:13	jumpman	right

I try to install react components via npm (react-dates from airbnb) and I managed to use it but the view of the component breaks down when using it. I only have to install the component via npm and that's all, or I have to include the CSS too?

2016-09-24 13:43:15	capitainIsh	Understood.
2016-09-24 13:43:24	krad	so i loaded my app from mydomain.com.. now for fb login, is my client app allowed to make ajax call to request user info from FB?  or the browser will complain about access origin policy?
2016-09-24 13:43:52	capitainIsh	If I could, a very simple one: Do I need to follow react tutorials first before jumping into native, or will it not matteR?
2016-09-24 13:43:57	GreenJello	krad, if you use the facebook js sdk you can
2016-09-24 13:43:58	GreenJello	krad, not sure what'll happen if you try to make direct requests to it
2016-09-24 13:44:28	GreenJello	capitainIsh, most of what you learn about react will apply

2016-09-24 13:44:37	GreenJello	capitainIsh, react-native just has a different set of built in components, e.g. View vs div
2016-09-24 13:45:14	capitainIsh	Got it. That's what I've read in my research so far (the official docs). I'm a bit overwhelmed though, as i'm jumping in from rails.

2016-09-24 21:04:13	halcyon	hey all
2016-09-24 21:04:30	halcyon	javascript question, looking for advice
2016-09-24 21:04:45	halcyon	i have written a array2D data structure.
2016-09-24 21:04:52	halcyon	and, this array is large
2016-09-24 21:05:08	halcyon	on this array, i have created a map function
2016-09-24 21:05:13	halcyon	but
2016-09-24 21:05:37	halcyon	because this array is large, i don't want to create a secondary array (as would be the case with map)
2016-09-24 21:05:48	halcyon	so, i created a forEach function
2016-09-24 21:06:12	halcyon	but, im not entirely down with using forEach and mutating the array (tho it is possible)
2016-09-24 21:06:29	halcyon	question: does anyone know a go between for map vs using for loops?
2016-09-24 21:06:44	halcyon	(noting that for loops work well enough)
