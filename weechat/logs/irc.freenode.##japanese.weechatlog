2016-09-02 10:06:05	justintv90	Hi
2016-09-02 10:06:40	justintv90	I'm struggling with Kanji, is there any tip to deal with it? :((
2016-09-02 10:07:04	Corin	Learn to write.
2016-09-02 10:07:10	karelian	learn words instead of individual kanji
2016-09-02 10:07:13	Corin	So you can actually memorize the radicals.
2016-09-02 10:08:16	Senpaoi	If the problem is struggling with Kanji, the fastest method to stop would be to kill yourself
2016-09-02 10:08:57	justintv90	Senpaoi: well done

2016-09-02 10:11:07	karelian	then my advice would be to keep at it. you'll start identifying recurring components

2016-09-02 10:11:43	Senpaoi	I have it
2016-09-02 10:11:45	karelian	it's easier to remember, say, 時 when you've seen 日 and 寺 in other kanji 
2016-09-02 10:11:45	furrykef	OK then
2016-09-02 10:12:05	karelian	and 寺 is 土 and 寸

2016-09-02 15:30:20	aradesh	i typed in a search request in japanese
2016-09-02 15:30:26	aradesh	it auto-does something
2016-09-02 15:30:31	aradesh	which kills the input from my IME
2016-09-02 15:30:31	derpson	well you can use other engines for that
2016-09-02 15:31:16	derpson	google are too ambitious. they won't stop before you have to use google for everything, OS, office, cloud storage, email, social media...
2016-09-02 15:31:48	derpson	i also hate the auto-searching.

2016-09-02 16:07:07	aradesh	i'm thinking about the following problem. given the list of base-3 numbers in order satisfying the following rules: 0 can't be followed by 1, 1 must be followed by 0, and 2 can't be followed by 0. how to get from one of these numbers, to their position in the sequence?
2016-09-02 16:08:25	aradesh	also the first term in the sequence has to be a 0 or 2 (because of the imaginary 0 before the sequence starts ^^)
2016-09-02 16:08:36	derpson	000, 002, 100, 102, ...?
2016-09-02 16:08:55	derpson	... okay

2016-09-02 16:10:12	aradesh	are len-4 ones
2016-09-02 16:11:03	aradesh	so for example i'd want to go 0210 -> 4
2016-09-02 16:11:03	derpson	and you want a i(n) that returns the index in those lists for number n analytically
2016-09-02 16:11:03	aradesh	because it's in the 4th position
2016-09-02 16:11:37	aradesh	yup
2016-09-02 16:11:51	aradesh	0000 -> 0, 0002 -> 1, etc
2016-09-02 16:11:54	CalimeroTeknik	is it an option to just generate the next index?*
2016-09-02 16:12:28	aradesh	generating them is fine
2016-09-02 16:12:30	aradesh	the reverse direction is harder
2016-09-02 16:12:31	derpson	do you dislike a recursive solution, i.e. going back checking for validity and counting the steps until 0? :3
2016-09-02 16:12:59	CalimeroTeknik	why do you need that reverse direction?

2016-09-02 16:25:52	derpson	as a library? if you generate it on the fly it will be faster to just decrement
2016-09-02 16:25:54	sneep	I hope they find the reason the thing exploded

2016-09-03 00:23:48	symm-	yeah it did
2016-09-03 00:23:59	cerni	15 frames means that you react in time, in which 15 frames changes on the screen.

2016-09-03 00:24:48	cerni	Since game engines for some games use it as the absolute measure of time, e.g. fighting games, frames are used to measure time.
2016-09-03 00:25:04	Lavos^	No no no.
2016-09-03 00:25:19	Lavos^	Frames don't determine time.

2016-09-03 00:25:54	adrian17	well the recent Need For Speed was frame-based, which was shameful
2016-09-03 00:26:02	cerni	For example, one can say: "This move has a start-up of 15 frames."
2016-09-03 00:26:30	cerni	It means that it connects with an opponent after on 15th engine frame.
2016-09-03 00:26:34	Lavos^	Only to mean a specific time because it's a specific FPS>
2016-09-03 00:26:49	karelian	mm, 26.1 normal, 17.1 easy
2016-09-03 00:26:59	cerni	Not every game uses locked framerate, as fighting games do.

2016-09-03 00:27:19	Lavos^	Because saying 15 frames is easy for animators vs 240ms
2016-09-03 00:27:24	Lavos^	At 60 fps
2016-09-03 00:27:29	cerni	For games with variable framerate counting frames is pointless.
2016-09-03 00:27:51	Lavos^	All games have variable framerate
2016-09-03 00:28:00	symm-	60 fps is the hardware refresh rate on a typical monitor, I think? and games have no reason to calculate more frames than that
2016-09-03 00:28:04	cerni	Except for those with fixed framerate.
2016-09-03 00:28:12	symm-	if you have a 120-fps monitor, the game will do that
2016-09-03 00:28:14	karelian	I know games with fixed framerate
2016-09-03 00:28:21	Lavos^	How do you think a fixed framerate works?
2016-09-03 00:28:30	karelian	of course they can fall below that if there's 処理落ち
2016-09-03 00:29:27	cerni	For fighting games this is a common goal.
2016-09-03 00:29:29	symm-	Lavos^: in my dabbling experience, there is a flag you set when initializing DirectX, and then when you submit a frame, the call doesn't return to you until the next hardware frame, so it's "naturally enforced"
2016-09-03 00:29:46	karelian	like all the touhou games are designed for constant 60 fps. also Dustforce
2016-09-03 00:29:58	cerni	And having a fixed hardware, it's possible to practically guarantee stable framerate.
2016-09-03 00:30:12	symm-	cerni: hopefully
2016-09-03 00:30:16	Lavos^	That still doesn't say anything about the frametime though.
2016-09-03 00:30:20	symm-	in open environments it can be hard
2016-09-03 00:30:42	symm-	(but still easier thanks to having given hardware)
2016-09-03 00:30:53	cerni	Frame time is 1 second/number of frames per second.
2016-09-03 00:30:56	Lavos^	You could be staring into a wall vs standing at the top of the world rednering for miles into the distance with a hundred NPCs.

2016-09-03 00:31:12	symm-	yes, Lavos^ exactly
2016-09-03 00:31:16	Lavos^	You don't know how heavy a frame will be in advance, you have to sample it from the frames you've already rendered
2016-09-03 00:31:27	Lavos^	So it's never consistant.
2016-09-03 00:31:37	Lavos^	Even isn't on that crappy reflex game.
2016-09-03 00:31:54	karelian	Lavos^: basically you do all the game processing, and then there's ideally some time to just idle until you have to draw the frame. if processing takes too long, you just have to skip a frame
2016-09-03 00:31:54	cerni	Imagine a fighting game, where the worst case is easily estimatable.
2016-09-03 00:32:23	Lavos^	Which makes it variable karelian.
2016-09-03 00:32:34	karelian	that's nitpicking though
2016-09-03 00:32:45	cerni	You can know how heavy a frame will be in advance in some games.
2016-09-03 00:32:51	Lavos^	Well not really, if you're doing that 60/120/144+ times a second.
2016-09-03 00:33:11	karelian	go play some touhou games, I guarantee they'll be a constant 60 fps unless you have a really bad computer :P
2016-09-03 00:33:17	Lavos^	And the drawing itself is the heaviest part of the whole thing usually.
2016-09-03 00:33:44	CalimeroTeknik	and even if you have a bad computer, pytouhou will probably get even more fps out of it
2016-09-03 00:34:05	Lavos^	So you could draw it as well and then just not swap buffers until the specified time, but then you get lots of input lag and everything is way behind what you see on screen if you try to skip frames.
2016-09-03 00:34:40	cerni	What if the game can handle the worst possible case in 1 frame time?
2016-09-03 00:34:44	Lavos^	Anyway pretty much all games get the performance count from the CPU itself to determine time.
2016-09-03 00:34:56	cerni	It can guarantee fixed framerate then.
2016-09-03 00:34:57	Lavos^	Then you know what's going on

2016-09-03 00:35:44	karelian	if a game strives to be fixed fps, it's unfair to call it variable fps just because sometimes it has to drop frames on older hardware

2016-09-03 20:45:52	Corin	The only other scenarios are that the governments of the world take over the means of production and oust the 1%, but that creates a similar monster and leads to the same end, or there's some sort of revolution in which the automated systems are seized by the people and we establish a society where everyone is provided for.

2016-09-03 22:16:07	Rokku	is 来ない　any different to just saying こない?
2016-09-03 22:16:18	Rokku	i don't get it. 'ku' became 'ko' :d
2016-09-03 22:16:26	erkin	It's an irregular verb.
2016-09-03 22:16:32	⚡	jcay is already hearing as this characters talk in a sweet voice.... "ano... anata ha kureditokarto no..."
2016-09-03 22:17:13	Rokku	what's irregular again? (yes, i dont know kinds of verb XD)
2016-09-03 22:17:31	Rounin	irregular = in + regular, no rule
2016-09-03 22:17:36	erkin	It means you need to memorise different inflections.
2016-09-03 22:17:44	erkin	And the rules aren't very consistent.
2016-09-03 22:17:54	Rokku	okay
2016-09-03 22:17:56	Rokku	thanks
2016-09-03 22:18:17	cerni	For 来る they are pretty consistent.
2016-09-03 22:18:31	Rokku	i guess my answer was right, i'm doing tae kim's exercises :D
2016-09-03 22:18:35	cerni	It's just that 来る has slightly different bases for different forms.
2016-09-03 22:20:03	Rokku	is this word the same? 切らない
2016-09-03 22:20:07	Rokku	irregular aswell?
2016-09-03 22:20:10	cerni	No.
2016-09-03 22:21:13	Rounin	いく、くる、いう、ある、する、aaand there's like one more, but I forget
2016-09-03 22:21:36	Rounin	Basically a handful of very common verbs and their derivatives are slightly irregular, and the rest are regular
2016-09-03 22:22:03	Rokku	so, when there's a word that has only like one syllable for kanji, im just gonna consider adding another syllable that ends with a?
2016-09-03 22:22:19	Rokku	i guess not
2016-09-03 22:22:36	cerni	いう is not irregular at all.
2016-09-03 22:22:40	Rounin	くれる is the last one
2016-09-03 22:22:45	Rounin	cerni: So what's the past tense?

2016-09-03 22:25:19	K5	jmark: can't find key 'v1s'.
2016-09-03 22:25:37	Rounin	Yet, it's non-standard to say ゆった
2016-09-03 22:25:54	cerni	I wonder if it makes it irregular.
2016-09-03 22:26:14	cerni	I'd say no, just a pronunciation thing.
2016-09-03 22:26:17	Rounin	Yeah hm, perhaps it was bad form of me to refer to it as irregular
2016-09-03 22:26:35	Rounin	くれる、though... I've never heard someone say くれろ... Always くれ
2016-09-03 22:26:48	Rounin	That could be slang, of course

2016-09-03 22:27:55	Rounin	With ある, there's the negative ない... いく becomes いった instead of いいた
2016-09-03 22:27:55	cerni	ある, although they say it's irregular, is simply not used with ない. It even has 未然形 (あら).
2016-09-03 22:28:09	cerni	This form is used in e.g. あられる.
2016-09-03 22:28:40	Rounin	"is simply not used with ない" is an irregularity in an of itself
2016-09-03 22:28:46	cerni	I don't think so.
2016-09-03 22:28:48	Rounin	You can always make up a rule and say it's regular, of course

2016-09-03 23:09:43	aradesh	i was for a while as a child
2016-09-03 23:09:52	CalimeroTeknik	I couldn't bother to eat meat for 20 years
2016-09-03 23:09:56	aradesh	something like age 9 to 12 or something
2016-09-03 23:10:17	jcay	because of parents?
2016-09-03 23:10:18	aradesh	no
2016-09-03 23:10:20	aradesh	just a phase
2016-09-03 23:10:29	jcay	weird
2016-09-03 23:10:44	aradesh	was because of a friend at school
2016-09-03 23:10:53	CalimeroTeknik	just eating only stuff you wanted to eat, right?
2016-09-03 23:11:02	Rounin	It's always a bit awkward to eat one's friends at school
2016-09-03 23:11:05	aradesh	nah it was a conscious decision
2016-09-03 23:11:07	aradesh	i just wanted to be like my friend
2016-09-03 23:11:22	jcay	:D
2016-09-03 23:11:48	CalimeroTeknik	ah. but if you, say, cook only vegetables, are you vegetarian?

2016-09-03 23:12:11	aradesh	actually i think it was more like age 10-14
2016-09-03 23:12:16	aradesh	i was a bit older when i stopped
2016-09-03 23:12:24	CalimeroTeknik	I tend to cook only vegetables, and as a result don't really eat anything else

2016-09-03 23:12:46	aradesh	so i was actively a vegetarian
2016-09-03 23:13:06	aradesh	but not necessarily for ordinary reasons ^^

2016-09-04 16:01:52	aradesh	is that where you have to choose three things
2016-09-04 16:02:05	aradesh	and then one of the incorrect ones is revealed, andy ou're asked if you want to change your mind?
2016-09-04 16:02:17	jcay	yes

2016-09-04 16:03:02	aradesh	so you choose one with 1/3 chance of being right. if you were right and change your mind, you lose. in the 2/3 chance case, changing your mind will guarantee you win
2016-09-04 16:03:09	aradesh	so i'd take the latter scenario tahnks :3

2016-09-04 16:04:29	aradesh	the problem is, on a game show it would feel like a decoy
2016-09-04 16:04:35	aradesh	eg, maybe the host only does that if you picked the right one, and he wants you to change your mind
2016-09-04 16:05:38	jcay	yup, but I failed to understand why it is not the same probability weather Monty opens one wrong door before rather after you choose one door, because he will still open one wrong door, so it should be picking up form 2 doors effectively

2016-09-04 16:08:40	aradesh	if a door is opened before you make your choice, that will obviously make a huge difference
2016-09-04 16:08:46	aradesh	it changes your guess to 1 in 2
2016-09-04 16:09:10	jcay	but no matter what you choose, he will open one another wrong door
2016-09-04 16:10:10	jcay	and you don't know if you chosen correctly or not
2016-09-04 16:10:58	CalimeroTeknik	I don't buy into the probability thing for one occurrence
2016-09-04 16:11:09	aradesh	well, you know you chose correctly with a 1/3 probability

2016-09-04 16:11:31	aradesh	how do you mean, ct?
2016-09-04 16:11:39	CalimeroTeknik	if you played the game 1000 times, sure, change your choice each time
2016-09-04 16:12:15	CalimeroTeknik	that will maximize the number of times you win (assuming perfectly random stuff and no sixth sense)
2016-09-04 16:12:39	CalimeroTeknik	but if you play it just once, probabilities are useless
2016-09-04 16:12:48	aradesh	hmm... would you use that philosophy if the chances were something like
2016-09-04 16:12:56	aradesh	99.9% to win if you change your mind
2016-09-04 16:12:57	jcay	CalimeroTeknik: right
2016-09-04 16:13:21	CalimeroTeknik	aradesh, such a game wouln't exist :p
2016-09-04 16:13:21	aradesh	sure
2016-09-04 16:13:22	CalimeroTeknik	+d
2016-09-04 16:13:29	aradesh	you pick 1 of 1000 boxes
2016-09-04 16:13:35	aradesh	he then proceeds to open 998 wrong boxes
2016-09-04 16:13:36	jcay	well, you always win :D
2016-09-04 16:13:38	aradesh	and mysteriously skips over one
2016-09-04 16:14:19	CalimeroTeknik	but yes, that's what I do every day, in order to not fail in life
2016-09-04 16:14:20	aradesh	would you trust your sixth sense then?

2016-09-04 16:14:20	jcay	it's also a price :D
2016-09-04 16:14:29	aradesh	then your chance of winning if you change your mind is exactly 99.9%

2016-09-04 16:15:30	CalimeroTeknik	hm, I suppose so
2016-09-04 16:15:36	aradesh	your chance of winning on your first choice was 0.1%
2016-09-04 16:15:38	CalimeroTeknik	assuming your first choice is bad
2016-09-04 16:15:46	aradesh	which is 99.9% probable
2016-09-04 16:15:50	CalimeroTeknik	so you MUST choose badly at first

2016-09-04 16:16:03	aradesh	yup
2016-09-04 16:16:39	CalimeroTeknik	we need a philosopher for that
2016-09-04 16:16:41	CalimeroTeknik	a child would necessarily pick the right box
2016-09-04 16:16:47	jcay	according to losers law: whatever you choose you fail :DDD for mor me it's like 80%
2016-09-04 16:16:48	aradesh	i think that would just confuse the matter 
2016-09-04 16:17:52	aradesh	do child necessarily choose the correct lottery numbers, but they parents never let them? ^^

2016-09-04 16:18:24	aradesh	i used to choose my mum's lottery numbers sometimes as a kid, and we'd never win anything :(
2016-09-04 16:18:31	gracefu	a stranger walks by you and tells you to design any game of your choice where you have a higher probability of winning, then both bet $10
2016-09-04 16:18:39	CalimeroTeknik	speaking of which, I partaked in a contest where we had to write AI players for a trust-and-betrayal game
2016-09-04 16:18:40	gracefu	would you take that?
2016-09-04 16:18:43	jcay	yeah, you can always use the same numbers 1000 times :D the probability is the same as picking each time randomly :S
2016-09-04 16:18:44	gracefu	ofc you would
2016-09-04 16:19:14	CalimeroTeknik	I wrote a player that would always pick its moves at random, and it would always win against my teammates' AIs
2016-09-04 16:19:23	gracefu	or, stranger tells you he'll flip two of your coins and if they both land up heads, he keeps them, and if they don't, he gives you double the coins back
2016-09-04 16:19:24	aradesh	i remember we got like 0 numbers right and i was like "how is this possible ! D<"
2016-09-04 16:19:30	CalimeroTeknik	but in the end they didn't have the guts to submit my version and we lost
2016-09-04 16:19:54	CalimeroTeknik	same feeling as the child who gets it right at the loto but that nobody will let play

2016-09-04 16:20:53	K5	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lottery_(United_Kingdom) - National Lottery (United Kingdom) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
2016-09-04 16:20:53	K5	The National Lottery is the state-franchised national lottery in the United Kingdom . It is operated ... The UK's state-franchised lottery was set up under government  licence by the government of John Major in 1993. ... Saturday draws started on  19 November 1994, under the name 'National Lottery'; the first Wednesday draw  ...
2016-09-04 16:20:57	gracefu	wow
2016-09-04 16:21:07	aradesh	1994... so i was 9
2016-09-04 16:21:15	aradesh	i should have been old enough to know better
2016-09-04 16:21:35	aradesh	why wow?
2016-09-04 16:21:37	jcay	you didn't know maths :D
2016-09-04 16:21:52	CalimeroTeknik	of course he did
2016-09-04 16:21:55	jcay	those who know math never play in lottery
2016-09-04 16:22:11	aradesh	my dad knew math, but he buys a lottery ticket evvery week i think
2016-09-04 16:22:24	aradesh	well, he knows physics
2016-09-04 16:22:30	aradesh	or at least 70s/80's physics :P
2016-09-04 16:22:31	jcay	but I mean doesnt he realise how small the probability is :D
2016-09-04 16:22:38	furrykef	Technically some lotteries sometimes have positive expected value, meaning you will on average win money by buying a ticket
2016-09-04 16:22:53	jcay	furrykef: ?? w00t?
2016-09-04 16:23:02	aradesh	sounds like a badly designed lottery, lol
2016-09-04 16:23:06	furrykef	Of course in such cases there are so many other people buying tickets that your odds of winning are still slim
2016-09-04 16:23:15	jcay	most lotteries are 1/2 win if what you invest
2016-09-04 16:23:31	aradesh	ah i see, is this on occasions when the prize has grown really large?
2016-09-04 16:23:31	furrykef	yes.
2016-09-04 16:23:37	aradesh	hm
2016-09-04 16:23:42	furrykef	So it was paid for by all the times nobody won.
2016-09-04 16:23:44	aradesh	so it depends how many tickets you expect them to sell
2016-09-04 16:23:45	CalimeroTeknik	I don't play unless the probability to win is 1
2016-09-04 16:24:15	aradesh	maybe i'll start playing the lottery w
2016-09-04 16:24:20	gracefu	XD
2016-09-04 16:24:22	aradesh	someone has to win
2016-09-04 16:24:23	furrykef	CalimeroTeknik: so you wouldn't buy a ticket even if you only had a 50% chance of winning a million dollars (supposing you only get one ticket)?

2016-09-04 16:37:32	CalimeroTeknik	anyway, in order to dodge a bullet we need senses trained beyond the extreme and not just 24 hours of attention but a lifetime of it

2016-09-04 16:58:05	gracefu	and how the horizontal line connects with the left radical

2016-09-04 17:04:55	gracefu	ah
2016-09-04 17:05:15	gracefu	in practice 3 doesn't really end high, or maybe it's just the singapore accent
2016-09-04 17:05:19	gracefu	it only goes up a bit
2016-09-04 17:05:23	gracefu	it sounds more like a lower 1 to me

2016-09-04 21:32:24	aradesh	so when optimizing c++ code, it seems trying to make sure the data you're setting/reading from memory isn't jumping about in location too much seems to make a big difference

2016-09-04 21:33:08	aradesh	it's faster if you're reading memory slots 0,1,2,3,4,5,6...
2016-09-04 21:33:16	aradesh	rahter than 0,10, 1, 11, 2, 12

2016-09-04 21:33:22	aradesh	or writing to
2016-09-04 21:33:56	aradesh	for example...
2016-09-04 21:34:04	aradesh	say i have two arrays x and y each 1000 long
2016-09-04 21:34:21	aradesh	and i want to look at x[0],y[0]... then x[1], y[1], and so on
2016-09-04 21:34:50	aradesh	it would be faster if they were ordered in memory as: x[0], y[0], x[1], y[1], and so on
2016-09-04 21:34:53	aradesh	as opposed to being 1000 apart
2016-09-04 21:35:09	Lavos^	Depends on how you're reading it.
2016-09-04 21:35:24	aradesh	say i'm just doing x[0] += y[0]
2016-09-04 21:35:25	CalimeroTeknik	aradesh, hello to cache locality
2016-09-04 21:35:46	Lavos^	The access itself is the same, just depends on the work you're doing to get those seemingly random access points.
2016-09-04 21:35:51	aradesh	for i=0..999, x[i] += y[i], say
2016-09-04 21:36:04	Lavos^	As opposed to just inc eax.
2016-09-04 21:36:04	aradesh	i don't think so
2016-09-04 21:36:07	aradesh	i think the access is slower

2016-09-04 21:41:59	aradesh	hm
2016-09-04 21:41:59	Lavos^	Well, with CPU caching it could be, but again that's not the access itself, that's just optimisation on reading sequential memory.
2016-09-04 21:42:26	aradesh	ok
2016-09-04 21:42:34	CalimeroTeknik	well, 1000 apart if it's small data, with the big cpu caches of today… is still OK

2016-09-15 07:04:17	Hamtramck	Does that mean you have 60 days to do the thing, or does that mean you can't try doing the thing again until 60 days have passed?
2016-09-15 07:04:51	Repiphany	The sentence before says you can only enter the labyrinth once
2016-09-15 07:04:55	Hamtramck	Yeah.
2016-09-15 07:05:07	Hamtramck	Which was making me thinkit's a time limit of 60 days.
2016-09-15 07:05:17	Repiphany	i.e. there is no trying again

2016-09-15 07:12:00	Hamtramck	except I'm not really good enough at Japanese myself to be that confident that they mistranslated things, beyond the English having logical gaps.

2016-09-15 15:44:48	tapas	it has title in english
2016-09-15 15:44:52	tapas	ISOLATION GUIDE
2016-09-15 15:45:14	tapas	thanks it makes sense but what about that 168.1?
2016-09-15 15:45:41	CalimeroTeknik	I don't know but am curious.
2016-09-15 15:45:54	tapas	it seems that it should be relative to text size
2016-09-15 15:46:08	aradesh	gracefu: in this character, do you do the stroke order differently? http://classic.jisho.org/kanji/details/%E7%9A%AE

2016-09-15 15:48:07	CalimeroTeknik	tapas, it's possibly something like "The character O is to be at a ratio of 168.1%" (this にした is obscure to me)
2016-09-15 15:48:38	CalimeroTeknik	the grammar of that thing doesn't permeate my mind
2016-09-15 15:49:21	karelian	surely you know ~にする
2016-09-15 15:49:32	CalimeroTeknik	yes, "to opt for"
2016-09-15 15:49:37	karelian	that's too literal
2016-09-15 15:49:50	CalimeroTeknik	yes, but that's this nuance here
2016-09-15 15:50:03	karelian	not really
2016-09-15 15:50:04	SteveTheTribble	またね
2016-09-15 15:50:04	CalimeroTeknik	to… "go for that" option
2016-09-15 15:50:11	CalimeroTeknik	to make it such as this?
2016-09-15 15:50:13	karelian	that's better

2016-09-15 15:50:41	CalimeroTeknik	well, it's still the same overall meaning, we're taking a course of action here
2016-09-15 15:51:21	CalimeroTeknik	ah, I think I get it. (Oの文字)を[(168.1%にした)比率]になります。
2016-09-15 15:51:53	tapas	?
2016-09-15 15:52:18	karelian	I don't really understand the parenthesis here, but it's acting attributively
2016-09-15 15:52:22	CalimeroTeknik	I'm making groups
2016-09-15 15:52:42	CalimeroTeknik	(168.1%にした) as a whole is attributive to what follows
2016-09-15 15:52:54	CalimeroTeknik	and I again isolate that phenomenon within []
2016-09-15 15:53:59	CalimeroTeknik	the idea is that I can consider for itself whatever is within a group, and then take it as a single element in its container group
2016-09-15 15:55:28	CalimeroTeknik	that prevents combinatorial explosion from causing the number of cases to evaluate to grow beyond human capacity
2016-09-15 15:59:37	CalimeroTeknik	you could even compare that to function extraction (with just a return type, such as 'attributive' here, and no parameters)
2016-09-15 16:00:48	CalimeroTeknik	and then to produce Japanese myself, I reuse any function of the same type in that spot; if it typechecks, it's probably valid Japanese

2016-09-24 17:25:49	aradesh	they're non-zero
2016-09-24 17:25:58	aradesh	but you know how we generate the flipped version of the matrix?
2016-09-24 17:26:03	gracefu	the upside down triangle is abstracted away, you should imagine the whole board gets relabeled before you do anything to it
2016-09-24 17:26:08	aradesh	once in the flipped version, they correspond to a zero row
2016-09-24 17:26:19	aradesh	and the previously zero rows (l and n) become non-zero
2016-09-24 17:26:36	gracefu	i.e. you start with 0000... 0001 ; 0000... 0010 ; ...
2016-09-24 17:26:38	aradesh	the upside down triangle is abstracted away... but the non-zero rows are non-symmetrical
2016-09-24 17:26:43	aradesh	so you need to take care with that

2016-09-24 17:27:49	gracefu	isn't the reason the thing is reduced because they start with 0 and end with 0?
2016-09-24 17:27:54	gracefu	multiplier is always 0 so it becomes 0

2016-09-24 17:28:40	gracefu	i think it's better not to think of the flipping when designing the algorithm because it has no mathematical significance and the complication only invites mistakes... like what you may have done possibly
2016-09-24 17:28:53	aradesh	well the weightings themselves aren't symmetrical
2016-09-24 17:28:54	gracefu	also, symmetrical rows don't have the same values
2016-09-24 17:29:06	aradesh	as in the weighting for 0000 is different than the weighting for 1111
2016-09-24 17:29:08	gracefu	that makes it even worse to think of the flipping when designing the +='s
2016-09-24 17:29:14	aradesh	the weighting for 010 is 1, the weighting for 101 is 0
2016-09-24 17:29:19	gracefu	yeah

2016-09-24 17:29:40	gracefu	that's why when you say c and e have nonzero values that's a redflag for me
2016-09-24 17:29:48	gracefu	if they have nonzero values then they aren't removed
2016-09-24 17:30:01	aradesh	they have non-zero values from the previous step
2016-09-24 17:30:02	gracefu	or, you're possibly adding the value of l and n into d
2016-09-24 17:30:08	aradesh	but on the next step, they will have zero values
2016-09-24 17:30:14	gracefu	what
2016-09-24 17:30:17	gracefu	that never happens
2016-09-24 17:30:18	aradesh	as due to the flipping, they now correspond to invalid rows
2016-09-24 17:30:26	gracefu	nooo
2016-09-24 17:30:34	aradesh	one of us is failing to understand something
2016-09-24 17:30:38	gracefu	yes

2016-09-24 17:33:25	aradesh	if we were to keep it, it would become r0+r2 (a+c), 000 + 010
2016-09-24 17:33:38	aradesh	however, that is the set of rows that correspond to ANDing with 101 and getting zero

2016-09-24 17:39:11	aradesh	the flip is a natural occurrence from the fact that we want to AND with something to get a 0

2016-09-24 17:42:47	gracefu	the annoying part is that the flip doesn't just appear from the equation a AND b == 0

2016-09-24 17:42:59	gracefu	it appears from the triangle being in the wrong direction for += operations

2016-09-24 17:43:35	aradesh	well, all b such that a AND b == 0, are all b which a 'subsets' of NOT(a)

Then a japanese girl says to her friend "Baka gaijin" as they pass.  So i just say "Baka gaijin dewa arimasen"  She was like : O. then said stuff i didnt understand
2016-09-24 19:27:22	OverCoder	erkin, and hm, if that kanji is one, because it has one stroke, the the second is 2
2016-09-24 19:27:22	OverCoder	yay 1th grade lesson
2016-09-24 19:27:22	NateRiver	Is it not common at all to sit and eat on stairs in japan ? they dont have many benches you know ? That girl was a jerk
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Appleman1234	NateRiver, I advise not eating on stairs 
2016-09-24 19:27:22	OverCoder	where is evne erkin
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Appleman1234	NateRiver, especially at train stations 
2016-09-24 19:27:22	aradesh	stairs in japan are holy
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Rachmaninov	yes
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Appleman1234	NateRiver, parks have benches 
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Rounin	I've heard it's unusual to eat in public... Or, I got told by a classmate after I walked while eating mochi
2016-09-24 19:27:22	NateRiver	are they actually holy ?
2016-09-24 19:27:22	OverCoder	MOCHI D:
2016-09-24 19:27:22	aradesh	yes. every staircase has a demon which lives inside it
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Rachmaninov	you commited a sin
2016-09-24 19:27:22	Rounin	Or, not in public as such, but on streets and so on
2016-09-24 19:27:29	Rounin	What I did about it was absolutely nothing, and that worked great
2016-09-24 19:27:38	aradesh	but it can be a friendly demon
2016-09-24 19:28:01	aradesh	NateRiver: no not really xD
2016-09-24 19:28:03	Rounin	Sometimes you just have to be the baka gaijin you aspire to be, you know
2016-09-24 19:28:24	Rounin	Eating on stairs is our superpower
2016-09-24 19:28:24	NateRiver	hmm it was just so out of the way and quiet.  
2016-09-24 19:28:29	NateRiver	yeah thats true
2016-09-24 19:28:29	Rachmaninov	wow
2016-09-24 19:28:38	NateRiver	i guess the more better you are at japanese the more some people will dislike you
2016-09-24 19:28:49	NateRiver	but others will like you more too ?
2016-09-24 19:29:00	Rounin	It Is A Mystery
2016-09-24 19:29:07	Appleman1234	NateRiver, 完全に無関係
2016-09-24 19:29:13	ℹ 	cerni_ is now known as cerni
2016-09-24 19:29:22	NateRiver	like theres the two factions of japanese. Pro and anti gaijin
2016-09-24 19:29:48	aradesh	heh. pippa middleton's nude photos have allegedly been leaked. she made one mistake there -> having nudes in the first place! 
2016-09-24 19:30:03	Rachmaninov	when in Japan, do as the japanese do
2016-09-24 19:30:05	Rachmaninov	:)
2016-09-24 19:30:19	Rounin	Or you might say everybody else made a mistake in not having nudes
2016-09-24 19:30:21	Rounin	Why are there no nudes being leaked of me!
2016-09-24 19:30:38	Rounin	It helps if you look like Pippa I suppose
2016-09-24 19:30:38	aradesh	if you consider taking nude photos of yourself and you ever get into a public position
2016-09-24 19:30:45	aradesh	they'll probably reappear
2016-09-24 19:30:45	Rachmaninov	whos pippa
2016-09-24 19:30:50	Rachmaninov	the only middleton i know is kate
2016-09-24 19:30:55	Rounin	Yes... Then you can be all like "Yeah, where are the nudes of you, dipshit"
2016-09-24 19:30:55	aradesh	princess kate's sister
2016-09-24 19:30:55	Rachmaninov	oh
2016-09-24 19:30:55	Rounin	Mine are better than yours
2016-09-24 19:30:57	Rachmaninov	is she hot?
2016-09-24 19:30:59	aradesh	is she a princess?
2016-09-24 19:31:05	Rounin	Hot yes, princess no
2016-09-24 19:31:30	Rounin	She looks a lot like the princess herself... Or duchess I guess
2016-09-24 19:31:36	aradesh	yes, duchess that's probably it
2016-09-24 19:32:53	Jigsy	[13:30:42] <Rachmaninov> whos pippa
2016-09-24 19:32:53	Jigsy	Pippa Pig?
2016-09-24 19:32:53	NateRiver	so do european people think white americans are weird ?  Like they were whites born into a world of desendents from a rebel faction.  Japan taught me alot about how i have never been to my race homeland, and their race homeland is so purely their race in japan
2016-09-24 19:32:53	Rachmaninov	that's peppa
2016-09-24 19:32:53	aradesh	oh man
2016-09-24 19:32:53	aradesh	if she ever had a weight issue...
2016-09-24 19:33:00	aradesh	that's what they'd call her D<
2016-09-24 19:35:00	Rounin	NateRiver: Race homeland... Hm, Europeans think Americans are weird in general, but not because they're white
2016-09-24 19:35:00	aradesh	poor future fat pippa
2016-09-24 19:35:08	karelian	I find Americans different, yes
2016-09-24 19:35:40	aradesh	most europeans are white too
2016-09-24 19:35:58	Rounin	The main differences are cultural, I think... Americans tend to be more assertive, more aggressive, have a greater sense of agency, a great deal more conservative, to the point where it becomes neurotic and morbid
2016-09-24 19:36:13	Rounin	It's definitely a different culture
2016-09-24 19:36:19	aradesh	it sounds more like you're describing the US government
2016-09-24 19:36:48	aradesh	they behave different socially
2016-09-24 19:36:53	Rounin	Well, people are people everywhere, of course
2016-09-24 19:36:53	aradesh	i've met lots of americans, and rarely heard them start spouting out conservative rhetoric
2016-09-24 19:37:05	aradesh	they often seem to value different things than average people i know do
2016-09-24 19:37:12	aradesh	they seem to value their looks more, and coming across as polite
2016-09-24 19:37:33	NateRiver	Its just weird to be born into a continent that your ancestors took over or took a boat for a month to get to.  Like being born on the moon base
2016-09-24 19:37:38	Rounin	When I said conservative, I wasn't referring to politics, but rather... moralism, really
2016-09-24 19:38:01	Rounin	Political terms seem to vary everywhere... Like, where I live, "liberal" means right-wing, and in the US it means left-wing
2016-09-24 19:38:01	Jigsy	Sounds like the British.
2016-09-24 19:38:16	NateRiver	like if you are a white person in europe you are in the same region that one of your great^20 grandparents would hang out, not so in NA
2016-09-24 19:38:27	Rounin	Hm well, NateRiver, if humanity in general first appeared in Africa, then all non-Africans are like that
2016-09-24 19:38:38	Rounin	And if our genes originated on some meteor that hit Earth, well...
2016-09-24 19:38:43	aradesh	much less recently, though
2016-09-24 19:38:53	Rounin	You can always draw a line somewhere and say it's always been like that
2016-09-24 19:39:17	Rounin	Like, you have those linguistic conservatives that think the Correct Language was finalized exactly when they were a kid
2016-09-24 19:39:36	Rounin	And all changes after that are wrong
2016-09-24 19:40:08	aradesh	sounds good
2016-09-24 19:40:10	aradesh	except i'd take the date say 1880

2016-09-24 19:43:28	CalimeroTeknik	but then they said "oh well etymology? don't care bout dat nao"
2016-09-24 19:44:11	aradesh	english was already problematic by then. we'd already imported american catch-phrases at that point
2016-09-24 19:44:11	Jigsy	I'm still having some issues with の subtitution, too.

2016-09-24 19:54:09	CalimeroTeknik	Rounin, I have an example of a word that exists in both French and English. “homophobic” in English, « homophobe » in French. That word is broken, it was *created* with a meaning that doesn't match its etymological meaning
